In this module, we perform a first U50 card implementation.  The kernel code is unoptimized to acquire a baseline, the focus is on the tool options and understanding flow.
* Review code for host code and kernel code.  List the APIs involved to prepare the hardware accelerator and run the kernel
* Run sw_emu the first level of emulation
* Run hw_emu the next level of emulation using the hardware description of the kernel to simulate the design
* Run vitis_analyzer
* Compie hardware to create xclbin
*
