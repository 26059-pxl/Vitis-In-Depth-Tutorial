In the Vitis™ core development flow, an application program is split between a host application and hardware accelerated kernels. The host application is developed in C/C++ with OpenCL™ API calls. The hardware kernels, on the other hand, can be developed in C/C++, OpenCL C, or RTL. In this tutorial we'll use a C++ kernel.

The algorithm we will accelerate is a common linear algebra solver, the decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose.  For this purpose we will use the Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization (pronounced /ʃo-LESS-key/).  This solver is useful for several numerical problems, in particular for Monte Carlo simulations.
